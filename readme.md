### how to use it
If you are into stylish design, especially the type that you find in New York City you are in the correct place. you can actually go to the website right now an make an order for a croc, jacket, sneakers or some boots, just log on and shop!


### Biggest challenges
my biggest challenge with DesignHer was successfully deploying it to AWS.
I was used to simple deploys that allowed for attaching a a repo and the 
rest of the work was done for you, however in this case i had to manage a
full deployment in ways that i never expected. however overall it was a
very informative experience.


### Code Review
the code uses Node js as the backend and React as the frontend to display the ui.

as mentioned earlier Redux is used as the state management tool and stripe is used
as the merchant.

### final thought
DesignHer was a fun application where i learned a lot about cloud deploys
and how to scale a system, which is the start of somethign great in the future.
